# FSJS project 6 - Front-end JavaScript projects site using Static Node.js and Express.

For this project, I used Node.js, Express, and Pug for template rendering.  

The project displays six websites I created in which functionality was added using front-end JavaScript code.  The site also contains information about my career as a web developer, as well as a button allowing a user to view my resume.  

======= Design Modifications ======================

I made design modifications on all pages of the site.  The modifications were added to the bottom of the styles.css file.
1) I changed the font family and font color of the header tags.
2) I changed the font family, font size, and text color for all paragraphs.
3) I adjusted padding and line height for certain paragraphs in the site.
4) I changed the background and text color for the sidebar.
5) I changed the background color, font color, and hover background color for all buttons.  I also added box shadow and ease-in transitions for the hover state of the buttons.
6) On the Portfolio of Projects page, I added box shadow and ease-in transitions to the hover state of each project's image.
