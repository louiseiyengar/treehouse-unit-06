            | I am a Web Developer with front-end and back-end experience maintaining and modifying enterprise, 	web-based applications.  I have worked on a team that redesigned the front-end of a customer-facing CMS, and I have done maintenance and production support for enterprise, web-based CMS applications written in PHP, using a Zend Framework and MySQL database.
          p  
            | Currently, I am working to hone and expand my JavaScript skills, both front-end and back-end, working with everything from jQuery to node.js, Express, and Pug.
          p
            | In addition, I have good communication skills and have enjoyed working with designers, writers, and marketing personnel, using my web development skills to bring their ideas to fruition.
